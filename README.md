# WeatherAppViper

A simple weather app using a VIPER-like arquitecture (the difference to a pure VIPER is that this one doesn't use the Interactor).

No storyboards, no xibs, all UI is implemented programatically.

This project has a single dependency (Snapkit) so make sure you have Carthage installed and run

```shell
carthage update --platform iOS
```
